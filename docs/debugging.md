# Debugging

## Logging

Logging and debugging information can be bubbled up in two seperate ways, either
in the Jupyter service logs, or as `debug-event` messages from the kernel or
subkernel.

## Debugging

It is possible to run Beaker with a debugger. Reach out to the Beaker team for more information about how to configure your IDE to do this.
