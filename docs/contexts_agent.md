# Contextual Agent

The contextual agent is a LLM empowered assistant.


## Toolsets

Toolsets are, primarily, set of tools provided to the LLM that allows the LLM to
interact with both the subkernel environment and the front-end using the
[Archytas ReAct framework](https://github.com/jataware/archytas). Details for
how toolsets work and should be defined can be found in the
[Archytas documentation](https://github.com/jataware/archytas).
